# 👋 Hey there! 
#  Welcome to my corner of GitHub where data meets creativity! 🎉  

I’m **Salvin Dsouza**, your friendly neighborhood **Data Analyst** with **4 years of experience** turning data chaos into meaningful stories. Here’s what I’ve been up to:  
- 🔄 **Wrangling data** and building **pipelines** with **Python**, **Airflow**, and **Docker**.  
- 🛢️ Making friends with databases (SQL, NoSQL—data is data, right?).  
- 📊 Turning numbers into stunning **Tableau visualizations** that even non-data folks enjoy.  
- 🤖 Automating boring stuff so teams can focus on the cool things.  

When I’m not busy crunching numbers, you’ll probably find me figuring out how to automate my coffee routine ☕ or trying to make data puns (I’m an outlier, but I mean well).
